        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>Hello, I'm Xavier Hanin, and I am dev-aholic.</p>

        <p>It's been a while now, I've written my first for loop in BASIC on a thompson MO5 when I was 10, moved to C when I was 17, code in Java since 1997 and JS since 2006.</p>

        <p>Here are some very selfish details and facts about my developer history. No interesting content inside, you've been warned :)<p>
        <h3>Open Source</h3>
As a dev-aholic, I've contributed to several open source projects, some of which more famous than others. My open source development is mostly done in my free time, I've never been an open source professional.

<h4>Apache Ivy</h4>
In september 2003 while I was founding a software company called Jayasoft, I created a small tool to deal with dependencies in Apache Ant: Ivy. Te first open source version was in january 2004 and had a very good community feedback. In April 2004 I released version 1.0, 2 years later Ivy joined the Apache Incubator, and became <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/">Apache Ivy</a> in late 2007. I lead the development toward a 2.0 release in January 2009. Since then my involvment in the project has decreased, but the project is still used under the hood by several tools like Groovy Grapes or the Scala build tool SBT.

<h4>RESTX</h4>
<a href="http://restx.io">RESTX</a> is a lightweight Java REST framework that I created in early 2013 to make REST API development in Java fun and efficient. With 400 commits and 30k LOC in the first year it's been my major open source project in 2013. 

<h4>Voxxr.in</h4>
In 2012 when preparing my talk for the first edition of Devoxx France I created <a href="http://voxxr.in">voxxr.in</a>, a conference companion focusing mostly on conference planning. I've stopped the developments after the talk, but Frédéric Cambor took on the project and with the help of community managed to cover 10 conferences and counting.

<h4>Jarup</h4>
<a href="https://github.com/xhanin/jarup">Jarup</a> is a small tool to work with JAR/Zip files from the command line, especially useful to update properties files in JAR/WAR/EARs in script files. I created it in early 2014 when I needed to perform this task once again and decided to stop being too lazy to address it properly.

<h4>Qzui</h4>
<a href="https://github.com/xhanin/qzui">Qzui</a> is a a REST and Web front end over Quartz Scheduler. A very simple project which helps to isolate the scheduling responsibility from the rest of your application, helpful when you want to keep your web app easy to scale without cluttering it with the issues related to clustering a scheduling solution. I created the project in 2014 to address the problem in one of the RESTX based solution developed in my day job.

<h4>Xooki</h4>
<a href="http://xooki.sourceforge.net/">Xooki</a> is a small document engine written in JS, that I started in november 2006 after attending a talk by Alex Russel at Javapolis (which was later renamed Devoxx).

<h4>Xooctory</h4>
<a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/6427">Xooctory</a> was a continuous integration server that I created in 2007 in an attempt to build a whole software factory from scratch and try to address the problems of continuous integration scalability before the first CI as a service was made available. After one year of strong contributions with 40k LOCs I stepped back from my intention to address such a large subjects mostly alone, but I learned a lot from that experience and even worked with a French computer science lab on <a href="http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00684220">Mixed Data-Parallel Scheduling for Distributed Continuous Integration</a>


        <h3>Jobs</h3>

        <h4>4SH</h4>
        After one year of contributions as a contractor in the recently founded company, I joined <a href="http://4sh.fr">4SH France</a> and created its Bordeaux agency and Java development team in late 2008. I recruited a team of talented Java and web developers and web designers, with whom we have developed a bunch of innovative projects for our customers, ranging from the system which manages all the exchanges required to perform efficiently air freight operations in Paris and 6 other cities airport in France, to applications used by one of the leading real estate company in France. My role in the company is both to lead and operate the team (14 people in 2014), do the early technical analysis in the projects (before and after sales), and contribute to developments mostly to help people when they are stuck with highly complex issues. I'm also a company associate and take part to the company strategy.

        <h4>Independent Consultant</h4>
        From 2006 to 2008 I've been providing Java development services and consultancy as an independent contractor. During that period, besides the more traditional projects I contributed too, I was also asked to address chalenging Apache Ivy tasks for the Stanford University in the bay area, SAS company in North Carolina, EMC2 in Belgium and also LinkedIn, Nihilistics or Halliburton. I also delivered a large number of trainings, ranging from EJB3 to Adobe Flex through Advanced Hibernate.

        <h4>Jayasoft</h4>
In 2004 I founded a company called Jayasoft with 3 friends of mine. This has been a tremendous experience, despite the fact we had to stop the company as we built it after 2 years. During these 2 years we built a service called WorlOfJava, delivering a very convenient access to Java open source projects sources and javadocs from the IDE.
